considering:
- energy as the given intensity of the song,
- valence as how much happiness the song transmits
- danceability as how much the song makes you move;
- the given scores ranging from 0 to 1 where 0 represents a non-danceable song and without energy while 1 a lively song with a lot of energy.

among the 100 songs the average energy is: 0.65906
among the 100 songs the average valence is: 0.48443
among the 100 songs the average danceability is: 0.71646

I deduce that these values ​​indicate that the listener prefers loud, upbeat and catchy songs.

A better method would be to assign songs to different categories based on listening context and listener mood, and then calculate average energy, valence, and danceability values ​​for each category.
This would provide a more complete picture of the listener's audio aura.
